# [Classifast.com](https://classifast.com)

TypeScript rewrite of [Classifast](https://github.com/DmitryMatv/classifast),
originally built with Python/FastAPI.

## Accurate classifier of UNSPSC, NAICS, HS/CN/HTS codes, NACE, EMDN, ETIM and more

### Get the right category codes from the most widely used classification standards.

Classifast is a web application that provides easy classification of any text input according to international product and service standards like UNSPSC, NAICS, ISIC, ETIM, HS, CN. Built with FastAPI and modern web technologies, it offers fast, accurate semantic search capabilities for automated yet intelligent categorization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Install frontend dependencies: `npm install`
4. Set environment variables for embedding inference, API keys, and payments/quota behavior
5. Run frontend watchers and the app: `npm run dev`

Relevant embedding environment variables:

- `HF_TOKEN`
- `HF_INFERENCE_PROVIDER` defaults to `auto`
- `HF_EMBEDDING_MODEL` defaults to `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B`
- `HF_EMBEDDING_DIMS` defaults to `2048`

Reranking is served by OpenRouter and uses its own API key and model:

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- `OPENROUTER_RERANK_MODEL` defaults to `voyageai/rerank-3`
- `OPENROUTER_RERANK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` defaults to `30`

Embedding inference uses the configured `HF_INFERENCE_PROVIDER`. Reranking is
sent to OpenRouter's `/api/v1/rerank` endpoint with the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

The classifier page also has an off-by-default **Expand query** beta switch.
When enabled, `google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite` adds a short description after the
original query for embedding and reranking. The beta model inputs put each
classification instruction after that semantic text. Exact ID matches skip the
model call. Code-like queries also skip it after an exact miss. The original
text stays in the input, result heading, URL, and ID lookup. If OpenRouter is
unavailable or the API key is absent, classification uses the original text and
the ordinary instruction-first format. Provider failures are not cached. Shared
beta searches use `?enhance_query=1` in the URL.

Relevant Qdrant environment variables:

- `QDRANT_URL` is preferred when set. Full HTTP(S) URLs are preserved; a bare
  hostname is treated as HTTPS.
- `QDRANT_HOST` and `QDRANT_PORT` (default `localhost:6333`) are the fallback
  when `QDRANT_URL` is unset.
- `QDRANT_API_KEY` is optional for unprotected local Qdrant deployments.

Relevant payment and quota environment variables:

- `POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `POLAR_PRO_PRODUCT_ID`
- `QUOTA_FAIL_OPEN` defaults to `true`
- `CHECKOUT_GRACE_TTL` defaults to `300`

Frontend JS/CSS files under `app/static/` are build artifacts. They are generated from `app/assets/` and are intentionally not committed to git.

## Deployment

For production, deploy from the repo root with the provided `Dockerfile`. The image builds the frontend assets in a Node/npm builder stage and copies only the compiled files into the final Python runtime image.

For Coolify, use:

- Source directory: repo root
- Build pack: Dockerfile
- Dockerfile path: `./Dockerfile`
- Include Source Commit in Build: disabled

`docker-compose.yaml` can still be used for local or manual container runs, but the recommended Coolify production path is the Dockerfile build directly.

Application startup validates every configured Qdrant collection, vector size,
and required payload index without modifying Qdrant. Startup fails when the
schema contract is invalid. Prepare and verify Qdrant explicitly before a
deployment:

```bash
npm ci
npm run qdrant:indexes -- apply
npm run qdrant:indexes -- check
```

`qdrant:indexes` builds the Nest project and runs the TypeScript CLI in
`src/cli/sync-payload-indexes.ts`. Add `--collection NAME` (repeatable) to
limit either command to configured collections. `apply` is a live migration
operation: it backfills normalized ID payloads and creates or replaces payload
indexes. `check` is read-only. Run `apply` from a controlled maintenance
environment, verify the resolved Qdrant target before confirming the
operation, then deploy only after `check` succeeds. The CLI loads the
repository `.env`; values already exported by the shell or supplied by the
container take precedence. It exits 0 on success, 1 on a schema violation or a
failed Qdrant operation, and 2 on invalid arguments.

Synchronous classification stages run on one dedicated background worker per
application process. Each process admits one active classification and up to
four waiting classifications. When the queue is full, fragment and RapidAPI
requests receive HTTP 503. Fragment callers already over quota receive the
paywall instead, without taking a queue slot. Server-rendered pages still return
200 to visitors and load results in the browser, while verified Google crawlers
receive HTTP 503 with `Retry-After`. An active classification retains its turn
through query enhancement and every synchronous stage. This bounds queued work
and keeps health checks, webhooks, and cached-page handling responsive.

## API

- `GET /` Homepage
- `GET /{classifier_type}` Classification page (unspsc, etim, naics)
- `POST /{classifier_type}` Submit classification request
- `GET /health` Health check endpoint

## Testing

Automated backend tests live under `tests/` and use pytest as the test runner.
The existing tests retain their `unittest.TestCase`-compatible structure.

- Run the backend suite: `pytest`
- Run the frontend typecheck: `npm run typecheck`
- Run the Python typecheck: `python -m mypy`

`utilities/test_*.py` scripts are manual smoke/debug helpers for live integrations and are intentionally separate from the main regression suite.
